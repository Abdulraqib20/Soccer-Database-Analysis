## Introduction </br>
This soccer database comes from Kaggle and is well suited for data analysis and machine learning. It contains data for soccer matches and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016.</br>

For this project, I firstly cleaned the data in a seperate notebook before importing it to MySQL where I performed JOINS to merge different columns and tables together for further analysis. After the analysis using SQL, I exported the datasets to csv files to use for nalysis in this notebook.</br>
In this project, I'll be exploring the various datasets I have created from SQL after I was done with the analysis there.
</br>

The project process is divided into three parts: Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Conclusion. The datasets I generated from MySQL are also included in this repo.</br>
</br>
The project consists of two notebook files, `preliminary_clean` and the actual notebook file `project`.
